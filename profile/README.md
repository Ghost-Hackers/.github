# <p align="center"> About the Organization </p>
### <p align="center">Hi there! 👋</p>

Ghost Hackers (GH) is an organization started on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for the purpose of developing unique codes using various programming languages.

## <p align="center">Can others use the code?</p>
No. Currently all code being developed by GH and it's members will be `private` and not for `public use`.

## <p align="center">Are collaborators welcome?</p>
No. Currently we are not accepting outside help. If help is needed we will request it to those we deem trustworthy and knowledgable about our needs.
