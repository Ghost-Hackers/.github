# <p align="center"> About the Organization </p>
### <p align="center">Hi there! 👋</p>

Ghost Hackers (GH) is an organization started on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for the purpose of developing unique codes using various programming languages.

## <p align="center">Can others use the code?</p>
No. Currently all code being developed by GH and it's members will be `private` and not for `public use`.

## <p align="center">Are we looking for triage members?</p>
No. Currently we are not.

However, triage members who are accepted into the organization can play a huge part in keeping the repositories healthy, as they need to be triaged[^1] regularly. Anyone can help triage. No experience is necessary!

If you’re looking for a way to get involved with the Ground Zero project and don’t know where to start, triage is a great place to begin as it gives you a deeper look into current issues. The triage team(s) are a group of people with a particular role of making sure triage is done consistently across the organization's repo's[^2]. 

<details>
<summary>Different types of triages:</summary>

- Regular self triage sessions done by members on their own time
- Focused triage sessions on a specific board, label or feature

</details>

## <p align="center">Are collaborators welcome?</p>
No. Currently we are not accepting outside help. If help is needed we will request it to those we deem trustworthy and knowledgable about our needs.

[^1]: Triage is the practice of reviewing existing issues and pull requests to make sure they’re relevant, actionable, and have all the information they need.
[^2]: Repo is short for repository.
