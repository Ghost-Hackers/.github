> # Do we have any active projects?
Yes. Currently we are working on a few projects. One project is called [Ground Zero](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/ground-zero) which you can read more about below. We also have another project called [JARVIS](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/jarvis) which you can read more about below as well. Yes, I know: "We are very creative with our names." However, `the names are only temporary until a fitting name has been chosen.` And yes, I'm well aware it sounds like "Iron man" but that's not where the name came from. It's actually an acronym for "Just Another Rather Very Intelligent System". This program will be developed and used to assist us in all future endeavors as we grow and continue moving forward. The AI is not meant to replace anyone, but to help us in our day-to-day tasks and increase our performance and productivity while helping us to enjoy what we do at Ground Zero. Ground Zero patrons will also be able to interact with JARVIS as well, making it a fun and exciting experience for all to enjoy and benefit from. Or at least that's the plan. We'll see how it goes once we get to the point of implementing it into the website.

> ## Ephemeral Glimpses into our Current Spectral Works

Indeed, the spectral currents within Ghost Hackers stir with activity, as we channel our energies into the intricate tapestry of ongoing projects. Allow your gaze to traverse the veiled realms as we share whispers of our ethereal endeavors.

> ## Triage Conjurers Wanted: A Call to the Spectral Gatekeepers

Alas, the current specter assembly at Ghost Hackers remains small, and the ethereal energies of our ongoing projects resonate harmoniously within our spectral domain. At this juncture, the need for additional triage members is minimal, and the spectral winds do not yet carry the call for new guardians of the spectral repositories.

Yet, envision a future where the ethereal tapestry expands, and the need for spectral caretakers becomes more pronounced. In anticipation of this spectral growth, the gates of Ghost Hackers remain ajar, with the possibility that adept `Triage members` may find their place within our spectral sanctuary. `Triage`[^1], the mystical art of maintaining the health of repositories, is a crucial endeavor that ensures the spectral codes remain vibrant and untangled. Though the current need is subdued, future triage members, once welcomed into our ethereal fold, shall wield their spectral touch to keep the repositories in a state of mystical equilibrium.

<details>
<summary>Different types of triages:</summary>

- Regular Self-Triage Sessions: Embark on solo sojourns through the spectral corridors of our repository, engaging in self-triage sessions at your own pace and convenience. Let the whispers of code guide you as you unearth and address issues, ensuring the spectral well-being of our digital abode.

- Focused Triage Sessions: Channel your spectral energies into focused triage sessions, where the ethereal spotlight illuminates a specific board, label, or feature. Engage with the arcane details, applying your mystical prowess to ensure that every nuance is addressed, and the repository resonates with spectral elegance.
