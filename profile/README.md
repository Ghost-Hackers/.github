# <p align="center"> About the Organization </p>
### <p align="center">Hi there! 👋</p>

Ghost Hackers (GH) is an organization started on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for the purpose of developing unique codes using various programming languages.

## <p align="center">Can others use our code?</p>
No. Currently all code being developed by G.H. and it's members will remain `private` and therefore not for `public` use. However, you can visit our archived projects by going to the [Ghost Hacker's Archive](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers-Archive) to view any completed past projects that are available to the public.

## <p align="center">Do we have any active projects?</p>
Yes. Currently we are working on a project called [Ground Zero](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/ground-zero) which is a project to create a company website for [Ghost](https://github.com/Ghostridr)'s future company that he is currently working on and wishest to start. The website will become an interactive website that will allow users to interact with the company and it's amenities and entertainment services. The site will be an integral part of the company and will be used to promote the company as well as to manage the company's services and staff.

## <p align="center">Are we looking for triage members?</p>
No. Currently we are not. We are still a small group. 

However, triage members who may be accepted into the organization can play a huge part in keeping the repositories healthy, as they need to be triaged[^1] regularly. Luckily, anyone can help triage; little to no experience is necessary!

If you’re looking for a way to get involved with the **Ground Zero** project and don’t know where to start, triage is a great place to begin as it gives you a deeper look into any current issues we may have. Triage team(s) are a group of people with a particular role of making sure triage is done consistently across the organization's repo's[^2], helping us keep it neat and tidy for reviewing and tracking, as well as the closing of any issues.

<details>
<summary>Different types of triages:</summary>

- Regular self triage sessions done by members on their own time
- Focused triage sessions on a specific board, label or feature

</details>

## <p align="center">Are collaborators welcome?</p>
Currently we are not actively accepting outside help. If help is needed we will send a request in the form of an invite to those we deem trustworthy and knowledgable about our needs and goals. 

[^1]: Triage is the practice of reviewing existing issues and pull requests to make sure they’re relevant, actionable, and have all the information they need.
[^2]: Repo is short for repository.
