# <p align="center">About the Organization</p>
### <p align="center">Hi there! üëãüèª</p>

Ghost Hackers (G.H.) is an organization on [GitHub](https://github.com/) that was created for the purpose of developing unique projects using various programming languages. So far we have completed one project which has now been archived.

### <p align="center">Contact US üì≠</p>
You are welcome to contact us if you wish or if you want to become a member of the organization and collaborate with us at the provided email below. If you are seeking to join us then we will get back with you if we are interested in expanding our team(s) at our earliest convenience. Please be advised that the checking of this email may be limited to a few times a week and any attempts at contacting us for anything outside of the email's purpose will be ignored.

### <p align="center">Can others use our code?</p>
No. Currently all code being developed by G.H. and it's members will remain `private` and therefore not for `public` use. However, you can visit our archived projects by going to the [Ghost Hacker's Archive](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers-Archive) to view any completed past projects that are available to the public.

### <p align="center">Do we have any active projects?</p>
Yes. Currently we are working on a project called [Ground Zero](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/ground-zero) which is a project to create a company website for [Ghost](https://github.com/Ghostridr)'s future company that he is currently working on and wishest to start. The website will become an interactive website that will allow users to interact with the company and it's amenities and entertainment services. The site will be an integral part of the company and will be used to promote the company as well as to manage the company's services and staff.

### <p align="center">Are we looking for triage members?</p>
No, unfortunately. We are still a small group and as such our projects have little need for a triage member at this time. However, triage members who may be accepted into the organization in the future can play a huge part in keeping the repositories healthy, as they need to be triaged[^1] regularly. Anyone can help triage as little to no experience is necessary!

If you‚Äôre looking to get involved with a project and don‚Äôt know where to start, triage is a great place to begin as it gives you a deeper look into any current issues we may have. Triage team(s) are a group of people with a particular role of making sure triage is done consistently across the organization's repo's[^2], helping us keep it neat and tidy for reviewing and tracking, as well as the closing of any issues.

<details>
<summary>Different types of triages:</summary>

- Regular self triage sessions done by members on their own time
- Focused triage sessions on a specific board, label or feature

</details>

### <p align="center">Are collaborators welcome?</p>
Currently we are not actively accepting outside help. If help is needed we will send a request in the form of an invite to those we deem trustworthy and knowledgable about our needs and goals. This does not mean that we do not wish to have you on the team, just that we don't feel we have a need for anyone more at this time.

[^1]: Triage is the practice of reviewing existing issues and pull requests to make sure they‚Äôre relevant, actionable, and have all the information they need.
[^2]: Repo is short for repository.
