No. Currently all code being developed by GH and it's members will be <sup>`private`</sup> and not for <sup>`public use`</sup>.

## <p align="center">Are collaborators welcome?</p>
No. Currently we are not accepting outside help. If help is needed we will request it to those we deem trustworthy and knowledgable about our needs.
