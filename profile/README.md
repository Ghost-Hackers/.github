# <p align="center">About the Organization</p>
### <p align="center">Hi there! üëãüèª</p>

Ghost Hackers (G.H.) is an organization on [GitHub](https://github.com/) that was created for the purpose of developing unique projects using various programming languages. So far we have completed one project which has now been archived.

### <p align="center">Can others use our code?</p>
No. Currently all code being developed by Ghost Hackers and it's members will remain `private` and therefore not for `public` use. However, you can visit our archived projects by going to the [Ghost Hacker's Archive](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers-Archive) to view any completed past projects that are available to the public.

### <p align="center">Do we have any active projects?</p>
Yes. Currently we are working on a project called [Ground Zero](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/ground-zero) which is a project to create a company website for [Ghost](https://github.com/Ghostridr)'s future company that he is currently working on and wishest to start. The website will become an interactive website that will allow users to interact with the company and it's amenities and entertainment services. The site will be an integral part of the company and will be used to promote the company as well as to manage the company's services and staff.

Another of our big projects that we will be working on building is an AI program called [JARVIS](https://github.com/Ghost-Hackers/jarvis) which stands for "Just Another Rather Very Intelligent System". `The name is only temporary until a fitting name has been chosen.` 

This program will be built in `CPP` and will be used to assist us in all future endeavors as we grow and continue moving forward. The AI is not meant to replace anyone, but to help us in our day-to-day tasks and increase our performance and productivity while helping us to enjoy what we do at Ground Zero. Ground Zero patrons will also be able to interact with JARVIS as well, making it a fun and exciting experience for all to enjoy and benefit from.

### <p align="center">Are we looking for triage members?</p>
No, unfortunately. We are still a small group and as such our projects have little need for a triage member at this time. However, triage members who may be accepted into the organization in the future can play a huge part in keeping the repositories healthy, as they need to be triaged[^1] regularly. Anyone can help triage as little to no experience is necessary!

If you‚Äôre looking to get involved with a project and don‚Äôt know where to start, triage is a great place to begin as it gives you a deeper look into any current issues we may have. Triage team(s) are a group of people with a particular role of making sure triage is done consistently across the organization's repo's[^2], helping us keep it neat and tidy for reviewing and tracking, as well as the closing of any issues.

<details>
<summary>Different types of triages:</summary>

- Regular self triage sessions done by members on their own time
- Focused triage sessions on a specific board, label or feature

</details>

### <p align="center">Are collaborators welcome?</p>
Currently we are not actively accepting outside help. If help is needed we will send a request in the form of an invite to those we deem trustworthy and knowledgable about our needs and goals. This does not mean that we do not wish to have you on the team, just that we don't feel we have a need for anyone more at this time.

[^1]: Triage, a sacred ritual, involves the meticulous review of existing issues and pull requests, ensuring their spectral relevance, actionable nature, and possession of all the arcane information they require. In the cryptic realm of spectral endeavors, the ancient practice known as Triage beckons ethereal beings to partake in the mystical dance of reviewing issues and pull requests. Let the whispers of the spectral winds guide you, as you traverse through the digital shadows, ensuring that each fragment of code is not merely relevant but pulsating with the essence of spectral wisdom.

[^2]: Behold the sacred repos, repositories known in the spectral tongue, are the crypts where the spectral codes find their dwelling, waiting to be summoned and brought to life. It is here, where the codes are woven into an ethereal tapestry, that Collaborators, spectral entities in harmonious alliance, unite their arcane forces to breathe life into the spectral projects that dance across the digital realms.
